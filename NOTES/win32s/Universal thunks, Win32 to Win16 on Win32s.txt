Universal Thunk Overview
========================

Win32s has the following design goals and requirements:

o Offer a 32-bit programming model for Windows 3.1 Enhanced Mode

o Use Win32 semantics for the windowing API

o Win32s supports Win32 apps with binary compatibility (same exe format)

o Win32s provides seemless migration from 16-bit Windows to 32-bit Windows NT

Binary compatibility and the requirement to provide natural migration
to Windows NT creates a portability problem for ISVs which have
Windows apps that require device drivers.

Win32s cannot support the Windows NT kernel device driver model on
Windows 3.1.  Therefore, the only way that Win32 apps running on
Windows 3.1 can access devices is through existing drivers supported
by Windows 3.1.

However, Windows NT does not support mixing 16- and 32-bit code in
the same process.  This is not portable and therefore, not allowed. 
There are a number of IPC mechanisms such as DDEML that would allow
data to be passed between Win32 and 16-bit Windows processes, but the
bandwidth is not sufficiently high for some types of applications.

Therefore, the Universal Thunk has been designed to overcome this
problem. The Universal Thunk allows a Win32 application to call a
routine in a 16-bit DLL.  There is also support for a 16-bit routine
to callback to a 32-bit function.  The simple Win32s thunk used to
implement this design also provide address translation services
allowing access to flat memory from segmented code and vice versa.

This design allows a Win32 application to isolate driver specific
routines in a 16-bit DLL.  The Win32 application remains portable
across Windows 3.1 and Windows NT; on Windows NT the 16-bit DLL is
replaced with a 32-bit DLL that communicates to devices via the
Windows NT model.


Universal Thunk Design
======================

First diagram illustrates Win32 Application using UT to access
existing 16-bit service.

Win32 application is binary compatible on Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.
 The Win32 DLL offers identical interfaces on Windows 3.1 and Windows
NT, however unique Win32 (32-bit) DLLs are created for Windows 3.1
and Windows NT.  This DLL isolates the different techniques required
to access drivers and hardware on Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.

UTRegister()
___________________________________________________________________________

BOOL UTRegister(hModule, lpsz16BITDLL, lpszInitName, lpszProcName,
                ppfn32Thunk, pfnUT32CallBack, lpBuff )

HANDLE     hModule;          // 32-bit Dll module handle
LPCTSTR    lpsz16BITDLL;     // Name of DLL (i.e. "MY16BIT.DLL")
LPCTSTR    lpszInitName;     // Name of exported init function
LPCTSTR    lpszProcName;     // Name of exported thunk function
UT32PROC * ppfn32Thunk;      // Output parameter (indirect 32-bit
function pointer)
FARPROC    pfnUT32CallBack;  // Address of 32-bit callback function
LPVOID     lpBuff;      // Pointer to shared memory block

This routine registers a universal thunk that can be used to access
16-bit code from a Win32 application running via Win32s on Windows
3.1.  Only one UT can be created per Win32 dll.  The thunk can be
destroyed by calling UTUnRegister(). UTRegister() will automatically
load the 16-bit DLL specified. It then calls the init routine and
provide it a 16-bit callable routine. The system creates a 32-bit
thunk that can be used to call the 16-bit procedure in the 16-bit
dll.

Parameters
----------

hDllInst

Handle of 32-bit dll. The universal thunk provides a mechnism to
"extend" a win32 dll into win3.1. The thunk is owned by the dll and
every dll is limited to have only one thunk.

lpsz16BITDLL

Points to a null-terminated string that that names the library file
to be loaded. If the string does not contain a path, Win32s searches
for the library using the same search mechanism as LoadLibrary on
Windows 3.1.

lpszInitName

Points to a null-terminated string containing the function name, or
specifies the ordinal value of the initialization function. If it is
an ordinal value, the value must be in the low word and the high word
must be zero. This parameter can be NULL if no initialization or
callback is required.

lpszProcName

Points to a null-terminated string containing the function name, or
specifies the ordinal value of the 16-bit function. If it is an
ordinal value, the value must be in the low word and the high word
must be zero.

ppfn32Thunk

Return value is a 32-bit function pointer (thunk to 16-bit routine)
if UTRegister() is successful.  This function can be used to call the
16-bit routine indirectly.

pfnUT32CallBack

Address of the 32-bit callback routine.  Win32S creates a 16-bit
callable thunk to the 32-bit function and provid it to the
initialization routine.  The 32-bit routine does not need to be
specified as an EXPORT function in the DEF file. No call back thunk
is created if either this parameter or lpszInitName are NULL.

lpBuff

Pointer to globally allocated shared memory. Pointer is translated
into 16:16 alias by Universal Thunk and is passed to the
initialization routine. This parameter is optional and ignored if
NULL.

Returns
-------

Function returns TRUE if DLL was loaded and UT16Init() routine was
successfully called or FALSE if an error occurred.  Use the
GetLastError() function to obtain extended error information. 
Typical errors are: ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND, ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND,
ERROR_INVALID_ORDINAL, and ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY,


Comments
--------

Registering the Universal Thunk enables two capabilities for
communicating between 32-bit and 16-bit routines.  The first
capability is to allow a Win32 application to call a 16-bit routine
passing data using globally shared memory. This is a Win32
application initiated data transfer mechanism.

The second capability is to register a callback routine by which
16-bit code can callback into a 32-bit routine in a Win32 DLL. Again,
shared global memory is used to transfer data.

The first capability is designed to allow Win32 applications to use
existing Windows 3.1 device drivers.  The design requires the Win32
application to poll the device driver just like a 16-bit Windows 3.1
application.  The globally shared memory buffer can be used to
transfer data from the device (read operation) or to the device
(write operation).

The 32-bit callback routine is designed to allow Win32 applications
to obtain information from 16-bit service providers.  This may be
necessary until the service provider itself implements a Win32 DLL
service.

The 16-bit DLL must EXPORT the initialization routine and the  sevice
routine, and  use the following function prototypes:

VOID FAR PASCAL UT16Init( FARPROC pfnUT32CallBack, LPVOID lpBuff );

DWORD FAR PASCAL UT16Proc( LPVOID lpBuff, DWORD dwUserDefined );

UTRegister() will result in Win32s loading the specified DLL with
normal Windows 3.1 DLL initialization occuring.  Win32s will then
call the initialization routine passing this function a 16:16 thunk
to the 32-bit callback function.  The initialization routine can
return data in a global shared memory buffer.

The initialization routine must return non zero value to indicate
successful initialization. If it fails no thunk is created.

UTRegister() returns a 32-bit thunk to the 16-bit UT16Proc().  This
pointer can be used in Win32 code to call the 16-bit routine:

dwUserDefinedReturn = (*pfnUT16Proc)( pSharedMemory, dwUserDefinedSend,
                                      lpTranslationList );

The Universal Thunk will translate the 32-bit linearaddress of the
shared memory to a 16:16 segmented pointer, along with all the
addresses listed by lpTranslationList before passing it to the 16-bit
UT16Proc() routine.

The 16-bit code can call Win32 code using the callback mechanism:

dwUserDefinedReturn = (*pfnUT32CallBack)( pSharedMemory, dwUserDefinedSend,
                                          lpTranslationList );

The 32-bit callback routine should be defined as follows (but does
not need to be EXPORTed in the DEF file):

DWORD WINAPI UT32CBPROC( LPVOID lpBuff, DWORD dwUserDefined );

See Also
--------

UTUnRegister(), LoadLibrary() (16-bit version), GetProcAddress
(16-bit version)

___________________________________________________________________________


VOID UTUnRegister( hModule )

HANDLE hModule

Requests Win32s to call FreeLibrary() for the 16-bit DLL loaded by
UTRegister().  Also, destroys the dynamically created Universal
Thunk.

Returns
-------

No return value.


Comments
--------

This call allows the single dynamically created Universal Thunk to be
destroyed and the 16-bit DLL dereferenced.  Win32s will clean-up
these resources automatically when the Win32 dll is freed (normally
or abnormally).

Universal Thunk auxilary services
=================================

The following are address translation services available for 16-bit code only.

___________________________________________________________________________

DWORD UTSelectorOffsetToLinear( lpByte )

LPVOID  lpByte;

Translate a segmented address to flat form;

Returns
-------

Equivalent flat address.

Comments
--------

The base of the flat selectors used by Win32S process is not zero. 
If the memory is allocated by 16-bit api it must be fixed before its
address can be converted to flat form.


See Also
--------
UTLinearToSelectorOffset

___________________________________________________________________________

LPVOID UTLinearToSelectorOffset( lpByte )

DWORD  lpByte;

Translate a flat address to a segmented form.

Returns
-------

Equivalent segmented address.

Comments
--------

The returned address guarentees addressibility for objects up to 32K byte.

UTSelectorOffsetToLinear



Universal Thunk Implementation Notes
------------------------------------

The following information discusses implementation issues that impact
application usage.

1)
Only one Universal Thunk (UT) may exist for each Win32 dll. 
Additional calls to UTRegister() will fail until UTUnRegister() is
called.

2)
Win32s will destroy the UT and call FreeLibrary for the 16-bit DLL when:

o UTUnRegister() is called

o The Win32 dll is freed (normally or abnormally)

3)
Memory allocated by 16-bit routines via GlobalAlloc should be fixed
via GlobalFix.  It must be translated to flat address before it can
be used bu 32-bit code.  Translated will be performed by the system
if passed as lpBuff or by using the traslation list.  It can also be
translated explicitly via UTSelectorOffsetToLinear before it can be
used by 32-bit code.

4)
The 32-bit callback function should not be used by 16-bit interrupt
handlers. The Win32 API does not support locking memory pages,
therefore an interrupt service routine which calls back into 32-bit
code cannot gurantee that the code is currently paged into memory.

5)
Exception handling can be done in 32-bit code only. Exceptions in
16-bit code will be handled by the last 32-bit exception frame.
