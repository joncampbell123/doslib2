386ID	 -- Return The 386/486 Component Identifier

The purpose of this program is to display the component and revision
level of your 386 or later CPU.

As you may already be aware, the 386 and 486 have a built-in mechanism
which is the definitive marker of the chip's component and revision
level.	For example, an Intel 386 CPU identifier of 0308 corresponds
to the D1-step which is an external name applied to revision levels.
Different revision levels represent different internal workings,
usually when improvements are made.  In contrast, the 32-by-32
multiply instruction error in the 386 was not corrected by a new
revision level, only a more careful screening of existing chips.
Chips with this correction are identified by a double sigma on the top
of the chip.

According to the Pentium Processor User's Manual, the component and
revision level fields are split into three parts:  a stepping ID (bits
0-3), a model field (bits 4-7), and a family field (bits 8-11).
Although marked as reserved, bits 12-15 are used in other CPUs as a
family member field.  For example, the 386 DX D1-step has a family
member field value of 0h, a family field value of 3h, a model field
value of 0h, and a stepping ID of 08h, yielding a value in DX of
0308h.	Furthermore on 486 CPUs, a model type of 0 is used for 25 and
33 MHz parts (040xh), 1 for 50 MHz parts (041xh), and 2 for 486/487 SX
parts (042xh).

Alas, until the Pentium Processor came along, a CPU's identifier is
difficult to obtain.  Like a mole unaccustomed to the daylight, it
surfaces briefly in the DX register when the system is reset and then
disappears.  User code has but a slim chance to latch onto this
slippery value.


The Plan of Attack
------------------

The accompanying program attempts to obtain this value through one of
several techniques.

The first technique considered is to see if this CPU supports the
CPUID instruction, and if so, use that to get the component ID.

The second technique considered is to invoke the relatively unknown
BIOS call to return the information.  If this call (AX=0C910h, INT
15h) is supported by the BIOS, it returns the component ID in CX.

The third technique considered is to shutdown the system in the
usual way, and, upon regaining control, save the value in DX.  My
experience is that this approach is only infrequently successful.  The
problem is that by the time our program gains control to save DX, that
register might have been clobbered by the BIOS code.

The fourth technique considered provides a means by which our program
can gain control after a system reset, but BEFORE the BIOS does!  To
understand how this can happen, we must explain some of the inner
workings of the system along with some digressions.


The First Few Microseconds
--------------------------

After system reset, the initial value for CS:IP is F000:FFF0.  You
might expect this means that the first instruction fetch is from the
physical address 000FFFF0 = (CS shl 4) + IP.  However, at system reset
time (and only then) the CPU artificially forces address lines A20
through A31 high by initializing the base address in the invisible
descriptor cache for CS to FFFF0000 as opposed to the expected
000F0000 (CS shl 4).


Descriptor Caches
-----------------

A descriptor cache is an optimization technique introduced in the
80286 and continued into later processors.  It is different from both
a disk cache and memory cache, although the intent in each case is the
same:  to expend a small amount of effort in the beginning to achieve
a benefit in the future many times over.

In this case, the cache is a separate location on the CPU to store a
summary of frequently accessed data.  In fact, it is more than just an
optimization technique as it is relied upon by any program which
switches from Real Mode (RM) to Protected Mode (PM).

The cache is used by the CPU as follows:  whenever a program changes a
segment register in RM or virtual 8086 mode (VM), or a selector in PM,
the CPU calculates the actual linear address corresponding to the
value and saves it on the chip in the cache for that register, along
with other information about that register such as the access rights
word.  Each segment/selector register as well as other frequently
accessed data on the chip have a separate cache.  The terms segment
and selector registers refer to the same items such as CS, DS, ES, FS,
GS, and SS; the names simply reflect the different mode in which they
are used -- segment for RM and VM, selector for PM.  In RM or VM the
base address in the descriptor cache is set to the actual value times
16.  In PM, the CPU looks up the selector in the appropriate (global
or local) descriptor table and uses the base address in that table to
set the base address in the descriptor cache.  Because this table
lookup is somewhat more time-consuming in PM, descriptor caches
actually have much greater value in that mode.	These caches are
called invisible because although the CPU has full access to them,
they can't be set or read directly by an application program.

The first far jump or call resets the base address in the descriptor
cache for CS at which time address lines A20 through A31 are no longer
artifically held high.


The First Fetch
---------------

Back to fetching the first instruction.  Because the descriptor cache
for CS is FFFF0000, the first instruction fetch comes from the
physical address FFFFFFF0 (using an IP of FFF0), that is 16 bytes
below 4GB.  As we want this fetch to come from our system BIOS,
vendors must decode the BIOS ROM at this address; typically they
actually decode it at multiple locations including FFFF0000 (required)
as well as 000F0000 (F000:0).  That is, the same physical ROM can be
accessed from different physical addresses.


Compatibility with 8086/8088 Programs
-------------------------------------

Now for a bit of history on how the IBM AT and later systems maintain
a certain degree of compatibility with the 8086/8088 processors.  When
these early CPUs encountered a segment and offset which together
exceed the limit of its 20-bit address space (such as FFFF:0010 =
00100000), they automatically wrap at one megabyte back down to zero.
Thus FFFF:0010 is identical to 0:0, or more accurately, memory
references to the former location are satisfied from the latter
location.  When the IBM AT was designed to use a 80286 CPU, its
architects faced a problem.  The newer processor was oriented more
toward PM operation.  Consequently, it didn't automatically wrap
addresses at 1MB, as that would defeat the purpose of having a
continuous stream of RAM at 1MB and beyond.  Nonetheless, the AT's
designers decided to emulate this odd behavior because they understood
well the need for compatibility.  That is, there were (and still are)
many programs which rely upon the 1MB wrap as it is called.

Because the 8086/8088 processors have a 20-bit address space, they
need address bits A0 to A19 only.  The maximum address which can be
generated in RM (FFFF:FFFF) has 21 significant bits, that is, of the
bits beyond A19 only A20 is non-zero.  The AT's designers realized
that they could emulate the 1MB wrap by artificially forcing A20 to
zero.  Thus the mechanism used to emulate this behavior and obtain
compatibility is called the A20 gate.  Originally, it was controlled
by a single bit in the output port byte (a kitchen sink catchall) of
the 8042 PPI (Programmable Peripheral Interface) chip on the system
board.	The two values of this bit correspond to the two states of the
A20 gate.  The value zero means that A20 is forced to zero regardless
of what address the CPU generates; a value of one means that A20 is
untouched, that is, controlled by the CPU to have whatever value the
CPU calculates.  In this way, with A20 disabled (forced to zero)
although the CPU may generate an address of 00100000 when presented
with FFFF:0010, the actual address the bus sees is 00000000.

As a side note, the A20 gate has caused fits for several system
designers.  When memory cache controllers were introduced into PC
systems, some designers forgot about the A20 gate.  That is, they
designed their systems such that (from a logical perspective) the
sequence of control was from the CPU to the memory cache to the A20
gate circuitry to the bus.  A problem occurs in the following sequence
with (say) A20 enabled:  read from FFFF:0010 (thus putting the value
at physical address 1MB into the cache), disable the A20 gate, and
read again from FFFF:0010.  The program expects to get the second
value from physical address zero (because A20 is now disabled), but if
the memory cache controller doesn't know that the A20 gate has changed
it will provide the CPU with the (incorrect) value from its memory
cache for physical address 1MB.

Moreover, consider what happens with the 486 CPU which has an onboard
memory cache.  Without really having any choice, Intel decided to
immortalize this behavior in silicon by defining an input pin (A20M#)
on the 486 to allow external circuitry to control the state of the A20
address line which the cache sees so that it would work correctly.

One more digression about the A20 gate:  why is it so important to
emulate the 1MB wrap?  Isn't this a problem that could be solved
simply by more careful programming?  Yes, but it's too late.  Quite
likely, your hard disk is infested with numerous programs which under
certain circumstances will fail if the 1MB wrap weren't emulated.  The
major perpetrator of this feature is the EXEPACK program as well as
the corresponding option to the linker.  In particular, the code which
EXEPACK prefixes onto your packed .EXE files is dependent upon the 1MB
wrap.  In particular, if such a program is loaded with its code
segment at 0FF0h or lower (essentially anywhere within the first 64KB)
and the A20 gate is enabled (thus not emulating the 1MB wrap), the
unpacking code fails with the message "Packed file is corrupt!".
Moreover, MS-DOS 5.0 and later versions go to extra effort when
loading a program to patch a packed .EXE file to avoid the 1MB wrap
dependency.  This was down in MS-DOS 5.0 and not earlier versions
because that was the first version which could free up enough low DOS
memory (via DOS=HIGH) to allow a program to run below 64 KB and thus
exacerbate the packed .EXE file bug.


The First Fetch Continued
-------------------------

Now back to the A20 gate and fetching the first instruction.  When the
system first powers on, the A20 gate is enabled (and the 1MB wrap is
not emulated).	What happens if subsequently the system is reset after
the A20 gate is disabled?  The CPU generates an instruction fetch from
FFFFFFF0 but the A20 gate circuitry artifically pulls down address
line A20.  Thus the bus fetches data from address FFEFFFF0 (that is,
4GB - 1MB - 16).  Because this address typically corresponds not to
memory but thin air, the data fetched is usually FF FF FF ...  which
when interpreted by the CPU is an invalid opcode.  Hence, INT 06h (the
Invalid Opcode interrupt) is signalled BEFORE the first instruction in
the system BIOS is executed.  Thus, by placing our own INT 06h handler
into the RM interrupt descriptor table, we can gain control
immediately upon system reset and save the component ID before the
BIOS can use that register for some other purpose.  After saving away
the component ID, our INT 06h handler enables A20 and resets the
system again at which point the first instruction is fetched from
FFFFFFF0 as expected and the system BIOS begins execution.

Note that this technique can fail.  In particular, some systems do not
have what is called a fully-terminated bus.  That is, some systems
return arbitrary data from addresses with which there is no
corresponding memory (such as FFEFFFF0).  As the technique described
above is dependent upon reading FF FF from such addresses, it can
fail.  To detect this failure, we read two bytes from FFEFFFF0 and
ensure that they are FF FF.  If not, we don't attempt a system
shutdown with A20 disabled.

A combination of all these techniques is used in 386ID.COM.  That is,
first we try the CPOUD instruction and then the BIOS call.  Then we
install an INT 06h handler, and shutdown the system.  The value of DX
from either or both of the INT 06h handler or the system shutdown is
captured and displayed.  This maximizes our chance of obtaining the
elusive CPU identifier.  One or more of the following messages is
displayed at the end:

1.  The component ID is ____ from the CPUID instruction.
2.  The component ID is ____ from the BIOS.
3.  The component ID is ____ from the INT 06h handler (____:____).
4.  The component ID is ____ from the type 0A shutdown.

The address in the third message is that of the invalid opcode and
should always be F000:FFF0, thus re-affirming the validity of the
technique used.

For reference, here's a partial list of component and revision levels
for several 386 and 486 CPUs.  Note that, for 386 CPUs the family
member field is not consecutive:  0h for the DX, 2h for the SX, and 4h
for the SL.

Programming Notes
-----------------

This program does a lot, so don't be surprised if you don't understand
everything at first.  Enabling and disabling A20 is not a simple task,
complicated both by the several different ways system vendors have
defined as well as the difficulty of dealing with a mostly
undocumented interface (the keyboard controller, typically an 8042,
and the keyboard chip, typically a 6805).  For simplicity, 386ID
handles ISA/EISA and Micro Channel systems only.  There are many ways
of gating A20, not all of which can be represented here.  If you have
a problem running this program, try installing HIMEM.SYS (without
EMM386) and try again.

This program is driven by the need to shutdown the system, so we'll
describe its operation from that viewpoint.  The various shutdowns and
the trailing code are summarized as follows:

1.  Type 0Ah (8259 not re-initialized):  Preparation up to this point
includes ensuring we're on a 386 or later CPU, saving control
registers to be restored later, installing interrupt handlers,
splitting case depending upon the system type (ISA/EISA and Micro
Channel), degating A20 (unless the bus is not fully terminated),
disabling the interrupt mask register in the 8259, disabling the
watchdog timer (if present), saving the original value of the shutdown
byte, setting the shutdown return address, disabling NMI, and finally
shutting down the processor.

This shutdown has one purpose:	Save DX without executing 8259
initialization code in case that code would clobber DX.


2.  Type 05h (8259 re-initialized):  In preparation for this shutdown,
we enable A20 to avoid a second INT 06h interrupt.  If we didn't
signal INT 06h on the first try, there's no reason to expect this
shutdown will have any better luck.


3.  Second type 05h:  This shutdown is generated from within the
Invalid Opcode handler after saving DX and re-enabling A20.


4.  After the last shutdown, we disable A20 (presumably to its
original state).  In any case, we enable NMI, restore the original
value of the shutdown byte, as well as the original state of the 8259,
and the INT 06h handler, and then display messages based upon what
happened.


To avoid cluttering up the main assembler file, most equates, records
and structures have been relegated to include files of which there
are several.

One final note:  although you might expect to learn much more about
this program by running it through your favorite debugger,
unfortunately that's not practical because of the several system
shutdowns it requires.	A 386 hardware debugger such as Periscope
Model IV is invaluable when debugging programs such as this.

Finally, a word of acknowledgement.  Thanks go to Jeff Bozbin formerly
of Phoenix Technologies for explaining the role A20 plays in this
sequence of events.


For completeness, here are the possible error messages:

様> The CPU is not an 80386 or later.
    (Self-explanatory.)

様> Unable to run from Virtual 8086 Mode.
    (Because we need to shutdown the system, we need to start from
     Real Mode.)

様> Unable to disable the A20 line.
    (There's a problem with the A20 gate that is hardware-related.)

様> This system does not have a fully-terminated bus,
    so we did not attempt system shutdown.
    (We tried reading data from 4GB - 1MB - 16 (FFEFFFF0) and either
     the call failed or the data returned wasn't FF FF).
